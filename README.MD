## Environment Server

#### A NodeJS Server that stores your .env files so you don't have to

### Disclaimer

**PLEASE** don't use this exposed to the public. I'm not a security expert and there are probably security holes,(i.e no authorization,etc.) This project is only meant to be exposed in a **local** network, like a raspberry pi or something. If you do not heed my warning, don't come and complain to me :)

## Purpose

Ever switch between computers or environments and ever say to yourself, "Dang, I have to go and get my env files to set up this project... ugh". Yea me too. Now imagine for all of your dormant side projects that you have to do that for. That poor USB stick is going to get tired of your schnanigans, so why not have a local computer that manages that for you. And that is what birthed this project.
